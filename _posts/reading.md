## Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective

> to write a review here

### why you should read it

- you learn how your code in the text file actually run on the computer, which becomes imporant
  after a while, when you want to debug problems or tune the program's performance
- it tells you about the humongous level of abstractions between you (the programmer) and
  reality (what happened in the computer), so you can appreciate why it's hard to write a good
  program
- it's used in foundation courses at Carnegie Mellon University (one of the best in CS)

<br/>
### who should read it:

- any programmer, seriously
- especially if you write code on an embedded system or a server

<br/>

  salary, handle non-tech problem. This is a good place to ask those things
